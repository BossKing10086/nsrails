h2. NSRails

Welcome! NSRails is a light-weight Objective-C library to make interfacing with a Rails back-end easy.


h3. What can NSRails do?

NSRails builds ActiveResource support straight into your Objective-C models, meaning CRUD operations and others can be called seamlessly via Objective-C methods. For example, all it takes to create a new user from Objective-C is <code>[user createRemote];</code> (after setting, say, a <code>username</code> property) and it'll go straight to your Rails server.

It's extremely simple to use but also flexible and powerful. Some features:
* Keep models and properties of your choice in-sync with Rails
* Support for nested models
* Support for basic HTTP authentication
* Asynchronous requests
* And tons more...

h3. How do I get started?

Add the source folder into your Xcode project, and follow these "three easy steps":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Getting-Started.

For more details:
* See the "Wiki":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki
* Screencase and formal documentation coming soon (promise!)

h3. What's in the sources?

The main class in NSRails is "NSRailsModel":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsModel (defined in NSRails.h). Also included is the "NSRConfig":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRConfig class for server settings. NSRails also makes use of a Objective-C JSON framework. And finally, I have to give credit to "ObjectiveResource":https://github.com/yfactorial/objectiveresource, whose library was largely the inspiration for NSRails.
