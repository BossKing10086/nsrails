Welcome!

NSRails is a light-weight Objective-C framework (iOS or OS X) that will have your app communicating with your Rails server in no time.


h3. What can NSRails do?

Simply model your Objective-C classes after your structure in Rails and NSRails will provide native ActiveResource-like support, meaning CRUD and other operations can be called seamlessly via Objective-C methods. For instance, saving a new Article remotely is as easy as calling @remoteCreate@ on your Objective-C @article@ object, and it and its properties will created via the Rails server.

The framework is very simple to use but also powerful and flexible. Some features include:
* Keeping models and properties of your choice "in-sync":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsify with those of Rails
* "Nesting":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Nesting your related models (has-many, etc)
* Support for "basic HTTP authentication":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRConfig
* "Asynchronous":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsModel requests

And tons more...

h3. How do I get started?

Add the source folder into your Xcode project, and follow these "three easy steps":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Getting-Started.

For more details:
* Watch the "screencast":http://vimeo.com/37418882
* Browse the included demo iPhone app - it goes straight to a live Rails app at "nsrails.com":http://nsrails.com, so you won't even have to launch a server to get started. The source for this site is also included. Have fun and be civil!
* See the "Wiki":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki

h3. What's in the sources?

The main class (and the one from which to derive your classes) is "NSRailsModel":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsModel (defined in NSRails.h). Also included is the "NSRConfig":https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRConfig class for server settings.

As per external frameworks, NSRails makes great use of the "SBJSON framework":https://github.com/stig/json-framework. And finally, I have to give a lot of credit to "ObjectiveResource":https://github.com/yfactorial/objectiveresource, whose framework was largely the inspiration for NSRails.
