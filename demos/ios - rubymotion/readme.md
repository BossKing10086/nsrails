NSRails â™¥'s Ruby
====================

To run this demo you'll need [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) installed and licensed. This is the same demo app as the Objective-C version, also going to [nsrails.com](http://nsrails.com), just written in Ruby!

Getting started
-------

### RubyMotion

* Add a `vendor` directory on the main level of your RubyMotion app if you don't have one already
* Copy the `nsrails` directory ([the main Xcode project](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/tree/master/nsrails)) into `vendor`. (You can delete `Tests/`, but keep `Source/` and the Xcode project file)
* Modify your Rakefile to include NSRails:

  ```ruby
  Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
      # Add this line:
      app.vendor_project('vendor/nsrails', :xcode, :target => 'NSRails', :headers_dir => 'Source')
      ...
  ```

### MacRuby

* MacRuby is even easier to configure since vendoring is not necessary. Simply drag the `Source` folder into Xcode in your MacRuby project, and it should be built with your project as normal.

Quirks
---------

Due to differences with Objective-C, there are some quick additional requirements in the Ruby environment:

* Right now there's a bug in RubyMotion (v1.4) where getter methods cannot be defined via `attr_accessor` - they'll have to be manually defined (`attr_writer` still works)
* Macros like **[NSRailsSync](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsSync)** should be defined as class methods returning a string
* **NSRailsSync** is required. And because Ruby is not statically typed, some extra things need to be added...
 1. `*` is unavailable - every property you wish to share needs to be explicitly declared
 2. The rarely used `-m` flag is necessary to define any has-many associations (ie, for arrays)
 3. Dates have to be declared as dates by specifying `NSDate` as a "nested" type

Examples
--------

### Class

```ruby
class Post < NSRailsModel
  attr_writer :author, :content, :responses, :created_at

  # Hopefully soon you'll be able just do "attr_accessor" above instead of this
  def author; @author; end  
  def content; @content; end
  def responses; @responses; end
  def created_at; @created_at; end
  
  # For details on this method see this wiki page:
  # https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsSync
  def self.NSRailsSync
    'author, content, created_at:NSDate -r, responses:Response -m'
  end
end
```

You're riding Ruby on Rails riding Objective-C riding Ruby! (Have we come full circle...?)

### Setup

```ruby
NSRConfig.defaultConfig.appURL = "http://localhost:3000"

# don't look for camelCase when receiving remote underscored_properties, since we're in ruby
NSRConfig.defaultConfig.autoinflectsPropertyNames = false
```

### Using the NSRails API

```ruby
# get all posts (synchronously)
error_ptr = Pointer.new(:object)
posts = Post.remoteAll(error_ptr)
if !posts
  error = error_ptr[0]
  ...
end

# get all posts (asynchronously)
Post.remoteAllAsync(lambda do |posts, error| 
                      ...
                    end)
```

In addition to the ones listed above, all methods in the [documentation](http://dingbat.github.com/nsrails/) are available!
