NSRails â™¥'s Ruby too!
====================

To run this demo you'll need [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) installed and licensed. This is the same demo app as the Objective-C version, also going to [nsrails.com](http://nsrails.com), just written in Ruby!

Getting started
-------

* Add a `vendor` directory on the main level of your RubyMotion app if you don't have one already.
* Copy the `nsrails` directory ([the main Xcode project](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/tree/master/nsrails)) into `vendor`. (You don't need anything but the `source` folder - you can delete `tests/` and `demo/`).
* Modify your Rakefile to vendor NSRails:

  ```ruby
  Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
      # Add this line here:
      app.vendor_project('vendor/nsrails', :xcode, :target => "NSRails", :headers_dir => 'source')
  end
  ```

* You're ready! Be aware of a few quirks in this environment:
 1. Macros (like `NSRailsSync`) should be defined with a class method named after the macro and should return a string
 2. Gets and sets have to be manually entered since `attr_accessor` and `@property` aren't quite that well integrated (yet!)
 3. `NSRailsSync` is required. And due to the 2nd quirk, `*` isn't available. You'll have to declare every property you wish to share


Example
--------

```ruby
class Post < NSRailsModel
  def author; @author; end
  def responses; @responses; end
  def setAuthor(a); @author = a; end
  def setResponses(r); @responses = r; end
  
  def self.NSRailsSync
    'author, content, responses:Response'
  end
end
```

You're riding Ruby on Rails riding Objective-C riding Ruby! (Have we come full circle...?)

```ruby
# setup
NSRConfig.defaultConfig.appURL = "http://nsrails.com"

# get all posts (synchronously)
error_ptr = Pointer.new(:object)
posts = Post.remoteAll(error_ptr)
error = error_ptr[0]               # retrieve error

# get all posts (asynchronously)
Post.remoteAllAsync(lambda do |posts, error| 
                    end)
```

MacRuby
--------

MacRuby is even easier to configure since vendoring is not necessary. Simply drag the `source` folder into Xcode in your MacRuby project, and it should be built with your project as normal.
Now simply follow the example above!
* The quirks are still relevant besides manually writing gets and sets - MacRuby allows `attr_accessor`.
