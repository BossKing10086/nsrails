/**
 
 ### Summary
 
 `NSRRemoteObject` is the primary class in NSRails - any classes that inherit from it will be treated with a "remote correspondance" and ActiveResource-like APIs will be available.
  
 Note that you do not have to define an `id` property for your Objective-C class, as your subclass will inherit `NSRRemoteObject`'s `remoteID` property. Foreign keys are optional but also unnecessary (see [nesting](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Nesting) on the NSRails wiki).
 
 About this document:
 
 - You'll notice that almost all `NSRRemoteObject` properties and methods are prefixed with `remote`, so you can quickly navigate through them with autocomplete.
 - When this document refers to an object's "model name", that means (by default) the name of its class. If you wish to define a custom model name (if the name of your model in Rails is distinct from your class name), use the `NSRUseModelName()` macro.
 - Before exploring this document, make sure that your class inherits from `NSRRemoteObject`, or of course these methods & properties will not be available.
 
 ### Available Macros
 
 - `NSRMap()` - define specific properties to be shared with Rails, along with configurable behaviors.
 - `NSRUseModelName()` - define a custom model name for your class, optionally with a custom plural. Takes string literal(s).
 - `NSRUseConfig()` - define a custom app URL for your class, optionally with username/password. Takes string literal(s).
 
 These macros can be defined right inside your subclass's implementation:
 
	@implementation Article  NSRUseModelName(@"post")
	@synthesize title, content;
	NSRMap(title, content)
	
	@end
 
 Please see their detailed descriptions on [the NSRails wiki](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Macros).
 
 ### Validation Errors
 
 If a create or update failed due to validation reasons, NSRails will package the validation failures into a dictionary. This can be retrieved using the key constant `NSRValidationErrorsKey` in the `userInfo` property of the error. This dictionary contains **each failed property as a key**, with each respective object being **an array of the reasons that property failed validation**. For instance,
 
	 NSError *error;
	 [user createRemote:&error];
	 if (error)
	 {
		 NSDictionary *validationErrors = [[error userInfo] objectForKey:NSRValidationErrorsKey];
		 
		 for (NSString *property in validationErrors)
		 {
			 for (NSString *reasonForFailure in [validationErrors objectForKey:property])
			 {
				 NSLog(@"%@ %@",property,reasonForFailure);  //=> "Name can't be blank"
			 }
		 }
	 }

 Moreover, this will not take into account anything in NSRMap - it is exactly the hash as was sent by Rails.
 
 You're safe to use this property after any method that sets your object's properties from remote. For example:
	
	NSError *error;
	if ([myObj remoteFetch:&error])
	{
		NSDictionary *hashSentByRails = myObj.remoteAttributes;

 This can be useful if you have a lot of nested models you need to destroy - you can do it in one request instead of several repeated destroys on each object.
 
 @warning Relevant for a nested object only. And, for this to work, make sure `:allow_destroy => true` [is set in your Rails model](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Nesting).
