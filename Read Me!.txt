Welcome! NSRails is a light-weight Objective-C library to make interfacing with a Rails back-end easy.


How do I get started?
=====================
Stick the Source folder into your Xcode project and do either or both:
- Watch the short screencast at http://nsrails.com/
- See the included demo iPhone app

Some readables:
- Read up on NSRails documentation at http://nsrails.com/documentation 
- See the included Troubleshooting file if you run into any errors


What can NSRails do?
====================
NSRails is very flexible and customizable so you'll be able to fit it right in with your Rails server.
- In one line, define attributes to be shared and not shared with Rails
- Get built-in CRUD methods
- Rails-side and iOS-side property names can be different, as well as with model names
- Full support for nesting models
- Encoding/decoding support for attributes
- Async support with blocks
- Support for basic HTTP authentication


What's in the sources?
======================
The main class in NSRails and the one to inherit from is RailsModel (defined in NSRails.h). Also included are a mainly-static NSRConfig class for app settings and an NSRConnection class used internally.
NSRails also makes use of the Objective-C JSON framework (https://github.com/stig/json-framework) and steals ObjectiveResource's NSString InflectionSupport category. ObjectiveResource was largely the inspiration for NSRails. Thanks guys!


Happy coding. Remember to visit the NSRails github page (http://github.com/dingbat/nsrails) to check out any update or patches.
