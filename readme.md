***

NSRails is a light-weight Objective-C framework that provides your classes with a high-level, ActiveResource-like API. This means CRUD and other operations on your corresponding Rails objects can be called natively via Objective-C methods.

Instances will inherit methods to remotely create, read, update, or destroy a remote object:

```objc
Post *newPost = [[Post alloc] init];
newPost.author = @"Me";
newPost.content = @"Some text";
[newPost remoteCreate:&error];     //This post and its properties created right on a Rails server
```

Classes will inherit methods to retrieve all objects, or only certain ones:

```objc
NSArray *allPosts = [Post remoteAll:&error];
Post *postNumber1 = [Post remoteObjectWithID:1 error:&error];

// Display your article(s)! They're ready with their properties populated directly from your remote DB
```

Features
--------

* [High-level API](http://dingbat.github.com/nsrails/html/Classes/NSRailsModel.html), yet flexible enough even to work with any RESTful server
* [Highly customizable “syncing”](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsSync) with your Rails attributes
* [Nesting](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Nesting) supported for relations like has-many, belongs-to, etc
* [Asynchronous requests](http://dingbat.github.com/nsrails/html/Classes/NSRailsModel.html)
* [Autogenerate](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/tree/master/autogen) NSRails-ready classes from a Rails project
* [Supported in RubyMotion and MacRuby](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/tree/master/demos/rubymotion)

Getting started
---------

### Objective-C

1. Drop the `Source` folder into your Xcode project.
2. Make an Objective-C class for your Rails model. Make sure it subclasses **NSRailsModel** (you'll need to `#import NSRails.h`)

  ```objc
  #import "NSRails.h"

  @interface Post : NSRailsModel

  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *author, *content;
  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSDate *createdAt;
  
  @end
  ```

3. Somewhere in your app setup, set your server URL using the `defaultConfig` singleton:

  ```objc
  #import "NSRails.h"

  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
  {
        [[NSRConfig defaultConfig] setAppURL:@"http://localhost:3000"];
        ...
  ```
  
You're ready!
  
### RubyMotion & MacRuby

  * See [this](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/tree/master/demos/rubymotion) readme for instructions on getting started in Ruby

Getting warmed up
----------

By subclassing NSRailsModel, your class gets tons of instance and class methods that'll act on your remote objects. Here are a few of the things you can do with your new class:

```objc
//retrieve post with ID 1
Post *post = [Post remoteObjectWithID:1 error:&error];
post.content = @"Changed!";

//update this post remotely
[post remoteUpdate:&error];

//fetch any latest data for this post (the boolean reference will tell you if anything changed)
BOOL ch;
[post remoteFetch:&error changes:&ch];

//call custom method - would GET http://myapp.com/posts/1/something
[post remoteGET:@"something" error:&error];

//all of these are also available async:
[post remoteDestroyAsync: ^(NSError *error) 
                          {
                            if (!error)
                              ...
                          }];

```

See the [documentation](http://dingbat.github.com/nsrails/) for more details.

### NSRailsSync

Use the **NSRailsSync()** macro if you want to define special behaviors for certain properties:

```objc
@implementation Post
@synthesize author, content, createdAt, responses;
NSRailsSync(*, createdAt -r, responses:Response);

...
```

- The `*` includes all of this class's properties as remote-relevant (default if NSRailsSync isn't defined). 
- `createdAt -r` makes `createdAt` retrievable-only (so that it's never *sent* to Rails - only retrieved).
- `responses:Response` tells NSRails to fill the `responses` array with instances of the Response class (also an NSRailsModel subclass, whose NSRailsSync will also be considered when nested).


See the [NSRailsSync wiki page](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsSync) for even more options!

Dependencies
--------

* iOS 5.0+ (and ARC)
