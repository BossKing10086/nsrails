***

NSRails is a light-weight Objective-C framework that provides your classes with a high-level, ActiveResource-like API. This means CRUD and other operations on your corresponding Rails objects can be called natively via Objective-C methods.

Instances will inherit methods to remotely create, read, update, or destroy a remote object:

```objc
Post *newPost = [[Post alloc] init];
newPost.author = @"Me";
newPost.content = @"Some text";
[newPost remoteCreate:&error];     // This post and its properties created right on a Rails server
```

Classes will inherit methods to retrieve all objects, or only certain ones:

```objc
NSArray *allPosts = [Post remoteAll:&error];
Post *postNumber1 = [Post remoteObjectWithID:1 error:&error];

// Display your article(s)! They're ready with their properties populated directly from your remote DB
```

Features
--------

* [High-level API](http://dingbat.github.com/nsrails/html/Classes/NSRailsModel.html), yet flexible enough even to work with any RESTful server
* [Highly customizable “syncing”](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsSync) with your Rails attributes
* [Nesting](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/Nesting) supported for relations like has-many, belongs-to, etc
* [Asynchronous requests](http://dingbat.github.com/nsrails/html/Classes/NSRailsModel.html)
* [Autogenerate](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/tree/master/autogen) NSRails-ready classes from a Rails project
* [Supported in RubyMotion and MacRuby](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/tree/master/demos/rubymotion)

Getting started
---------

### Objective-C

1. Drop the `Source` folder into your Xcode project.
  * If you're using Git, you should add NSRails as a submodule to your project so you can `git pull` and always be up to date:
   
      ```
      $ git submodule add git@github.com:dingbat/nsrails.git NSRails
      ```
  
      This will clone the entire NSRails repo, but you'll only need to add `nsrails/Source` to your project in Xcode.
2. Make an Objective-C class for your Rails model and have it subclass **NSRailsModel** (you'll need to `#import NSRails.h`)

  ```objc
  #import "NSRails.h"

  @interface Post : NSRailsModel

  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *author, *content;
  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSDate *createdAt;
  
  @end
  ```

3. Somewhere in your app setup, set your server URL using the `defaultConfig` singleton:

  ```objc
  #import "NSRails.h"

  - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
  {
        [[NSRConfig defaultConfig] setAppURL:@"http://localhost:3000"];
        ...
  ```
    
### RubyMotion & MacRuby

  * See [this](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/tree/master/demos/rubymotion) readme for instructions on getting started in Ruby

Getting warmed up
----------

By subclassing NSRailsModel, your class gets tons of instance and class methods that'll act on your remote objects. Here are a few of the things you can do with your new class:

```objc
// Retrieve post with ID 1
Post *post = [Post remoteObjectWithID:1 error:&error];

// Update this post remotely
post.content = @"Changed!";
[post remoteUpdate:&error];

// Fetch any latest data for this post (and know if anything changed)
BOOL objectDidChange;
[post remoteFetch:&error changes:&objectDidChange];

// Call custom REST method - would GET http://myapp.com/posts/1/something
[post remoteGET:@"something" error:&error];

// Async is also available:
[post remoteDestroyAsync: ^(NSError *error) {  if (!error) ... }];
```

See the [documentation](http://dingbat.github.com/nsrails/) for more details.

### NSRailsSync

Use the **NSRailsSync()** macro if you want to define special behaviors for certain properties:

```objc
@implementation Post
@synthesize author, content, createdAt, responses;
NSRailsSync(*, createdAt -r, responses:Response);

...
```

- The `*` includes all of this class's properties as remote-relevant (default if NSRailsSync isn't defined). 
- `createdAt -r` makes `createdAt` retrievable-only (so that it's never *sent* to Rails - only retrieved).
- `responses:Response` tells NSRails to fill the `responses` array with instances of the Response class (also an NSRailsModel subclass, whose NSRailsSync will also be considered when nested).


See the [NSRailsSync wiki page](https://github.com/dingbat/nsrails/wiki/NSRailsSync) for even more options!

Dependencies
--------

* **iOS 5.0+**
* **Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)**
  * If your project isn't using ARC, you'll need to selectively specify it for NSRails. Go to your active target, select the "Build Phases" tab, and in the "Compile Sources" section, set `-fobjc-arc` as a compiler flag for each NSRails source file.

A lot of NSRails was inspired by the [ObjectiveResource](https://github.com/yfactorial/objectiveresource) project. Thanks!
